# Rugby Laws Scraper

A simple scraper in node.js to scrape and save the IRB Rugby Laws of the Game.

Saves all laws as JSON, individually and as an array. 

To run, pass in either `all` or the law number as an argument. 

    // all laws
    node scrape.js all
    
    // Law 14: The Tackle
    node scrape.js 14
